## Neon Fractal Notes

- Fractals are drawn recursively from the center of the canvas.  
- Branch color, width, and opacity are dynamically calculated based on audio intensity.  
- Neon swirls orbit around the fractals for an immersive audio-reactive effect.  
- The center pulse uses radial gradients for glowing neon highlights.
